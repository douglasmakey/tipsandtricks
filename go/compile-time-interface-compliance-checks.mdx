In Go, verifying interface compliance at compile time is a simple but powerful practice. By enforcing that types implement specific interfaces before runtime, you prevent subtle errors and keep your codebase reliable.

## When to Verify Interface Compliance

Use compile-time checks for:

**Exported types that need to implement an interface** as part of their API contract.
**Groups of types** that all need to meet the same interface requirements, whether exported or unexported.
**Critical cases where breaking an interface implementation** would impact the reliability of your application.

## Example: Good

Let's look at how to enforce compliance correctly.

Adding a compile-time check ensures Handler implements http.Handler. If it doesn't, this will throw a compilation error:

```go
type Handler struct {
    // ...
}

var _ http.Handler = (*Handler)(nil)

func (h *Handler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // ...
}
```

## Explanation

The line `var _ http.Handler = (*Handler)(nil)` will fail at compile time if `*Handler` ever stops implementing `http.Handler`. For pointer types (e.g., *Handler), slices, or maps, use nil as the zero value on the right side of the assignment. For struct types, use an empty struct {}.

## Takeaway

Using compile-time checks for interface compliance makes your Go code more robust and predictable, saving you from runtime surprises and enforcing your API contracts.
