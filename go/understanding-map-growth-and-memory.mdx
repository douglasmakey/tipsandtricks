In Go, the number of buckets in a map can only grow it never shrinks. This means that as you add entries to a map, the number of buckets increases, but when you remove entries, the map's bucket count remains the same, with the slots inside simply cleared.

## Implications for Dynamic Maps

If you're using a map to store a dynamic set of data where items are frequently added and removed, the map may end up holding more memory than needed. To manage this effectively, consider reinitializing the map or creating a copy of it.

## Example: Resetting the Map

If you're managing state in a map that changes often, you can reset it periodically to release unused memory. Here's how:

```go
// Clear the map by reinitializing it
state := make(map[string]int)
// ... (populate and modify `state` over time)

// Reset map to release memory from unused buckets
state = make(map[string]int)
```

## Example: Copying to a New Map

Alternatively, create a copy containing only the active values, then replace the original map with the new copy:

```go
func compactMap[K comparable, V any](original map[K]V) map[K]V {
	compacted := make(map[K]V, len(original))
	for k, v := range original {
		compacted[k] = v
	}
	return compacted
}

func main() {
    state := map[string]int{
        "Maigualida": 22,
        "Jhonkeiferson": 23,
    }
    // Periodically copy and replace `state` with a compacted version
    state = compactMap(state)
}
```

In Go, maps only grow in bucket count, so frequently clearing entries doesn't reduce memory usage. For maps that change dynamically, consider resetting or copying to a new map periodically to keep memory usage efficient.
